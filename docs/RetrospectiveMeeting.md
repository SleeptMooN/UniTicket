# Retrospective Meeting
 
 
### What went well ? 

* We managed to overcome some difficulties regarding the use of flutter.

* We gained a better idea of what is really necessary and urgent in order to have a functional application.

### What didnâ€™t go so well ?

* For various personal reasons and/or lack of organization in the use of the group's time, we weren't able to develop what we were supposed to in the first iteration. 
* We were unable to run tests for our application.

### What have we learned ?

* We need to better organize the group's working time.
* We urgently need to start creating tests for user stories but also several features that we are developing.
* It is necessary to improve knowledge in the use of flutter and dart .

### What still puzzles me ?

* How we will best simulate the assignment and cancellation of passwords.
* How to integrate our project with the academic services software.
